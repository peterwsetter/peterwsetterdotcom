I'm Peter W(allace) Setter. 

Professionally, I work for a logistics company doing everything from reporting and analysis to database design to backend engineering. (I use SQl in different ways and with different languages/platforms.) 

Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors and the life I'm building with my wife.  

Through this blog and my fishing-focused project [Cutthroat Quest dot CO](https://cutthroatquest.co) I hope to share my interests and experiences and learn from the people who stumble upon this blog. 

These sites are very much works-in-progress. In the near term I plan on adding content and some interactive features. Over time, I'd like to learn a frontend framework and create single page applications using JAMstack principles. Currently, I'm comfortable with Python as a backend framework through [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and I'm interested in exploring serverless functions as an alternative. I've started to learn Elm several times but didn't have a project to keep me motivated. Now, I have ideas for website upgrades and a couple products that I would like to create while learning Elm.
